Re-implementation of LoFTR in TensorFlow;loftr-in-tensorflow/images/TF_md.png;Code;https://github.com/RohanG9929/LoFTR-in-Tensorflow;https://rohang9929.github.io/loftr-in-tensorflow/;Fady Algyar,https://github.com/fsa4859,Miles Kilcourse,https://github.com/milesk33,Suraj Reddy,https://github.com/surajreddy258;New York University;LoFTR can extract high-quality semi-dense matches even in indistinctive regions with low-textures, motion blur, or repetitive patterns. Because of it's robustness and superiority over other neural network methods a re-implmentation into Tensorflow was achieved. This is to further expand the userbase and reach of the LoFTR algorithm.
Optimized Image Stitching in Python;image-stitching/images/stitching.png;Code;https://github.com/RohanG9929/Optimized-Image-Stitching;https://rohang9929.github.io/image-stitching/;;New York University;This image stitching algorithm utilizes feature matches between images to compute an homography matrix. Using this homography the second image is warped, and then the two images are layed on top of one another. Then, dynamic weighted fusion is used to remove the seam line caused by the pasting of the images onto one another. The result is a stitched image with little to no seam line present.
Optimal control of a drone using an iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator;ilqr/images/iLQR.gif;Code;https://github.com/RohanG9929/iLQR--iterative-Linear-Quadratic-Regulator--for-a-Quadrotor;https://rohang9929.github.io/ilqr/;;New York University;The LQR and iLQR algorithms were used to control a 2D quadrotor to perform acrobatic moves. This was split into 3 parts, where a controller was designed for each.
Inverting a Pendulum with model-free reinforcement learning (Q-Learning);q-learning-pendulum/images/Pendulum.gif;Code;https://github.com/RohanG9929/Inverting-a-Pendulum-with-Q-Learning;https://rohang9929.github.io/q-learning-pendulum/;;New York University;Learning a policy for an inverted pendulum to make it do a swing-up motion, without knowledge of the model of the system.
Design and Development of a Dexterous Manipulator;dexterous-manipulator/images/dex-collage.jpg;Project Files;https://github.com/RohanG9929/Design-and-Development-of-a-Dexterous-Manipulator;https://rohang9929.github.io/dexterous-manipulator;Furqan Mahmood,,David Park,;The University of Auckland;The device created demonstrates the adaptive behavior of compliant, under-actuated grippers and their superior grasping capabilities under uncertainties. The device is very light-weight and was fabricated using rapid prototyping equipment and hybrid manufacturing techniques.
Augmented Reality in Python;augmented-cube/images/augment_full.gif;Code;https://github.com/RohanG9929/Augmented-Reality-in-Python;https://rohang9929.github.io/augmented-cube;;New York University;After calibrating the camera with an Aruco Tag grid and obtaining the Camera Intrinsics, the Pose of the camera in relation to the Aruco tag can be estimated.With the pose, a 3D cube can be projected onto the 2D image plane.
